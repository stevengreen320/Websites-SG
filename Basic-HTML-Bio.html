            <p style="padding-right: 500px; padding-left: 500px;">Ask me how do I feel Ask me now that we're cozy and clinging Well, sir, all I can say Is if I were a bell I'd be ringing From the moment we kissed tonight That's the way I just got to behave Boy, if I were a lamp I'd light Or if I were a banner
                I'd wave. Ask me how do I feel Little me with my quiet upbringing Well, sir, all I can say Is if I were a gate I'd be swinging And if I were a watch I'd start Popping my spring Or if I were a bell I'd go ding dong ding dong ding
            </p>
            <p style="padding-right: 500px; padding-left: 500px;">Ooh, I'd give anything Just to smell that scent Of honeysuckle growin' On a backyard fence Way back home, now. 'Oow!' 'Oh heaven scent, ya'all!' Yeah, way back home (Way back home) Thinkin' on back home
